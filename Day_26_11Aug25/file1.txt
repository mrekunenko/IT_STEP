Last weekend, I decided to take a long walk through the old part of the city. The narrow streets were full of small caf√©s, antique shops, and colorful flowers hanging from balconies. I stopped by a tiny bakery, where the smell of fresh bread filled the air, and bought a warm croissant. Later, I sat by the river, watching the sunlight dance on the water. It was a simple day, but it felt peaceful and reminded me how beautiful little moments can be.
